> We will have the elaboration from following aspects.

- Data replication and consensus
- Meta cluster
- SQL engine
- tskv index and data storage

## Data Replication and Consensus

The fragment rule of CnosDB 2.0 is based on Time-range. It uses the fragmentation rule of DB + Time_range to place the data in the corresponding Bucket. Bucket is a virtual logic unit. Each Bucket consists of the following main properties. Bucket creates multiple fragments based on user configurations, dissipating data (suppose data fragment Shad Num is 1).> 「db, shardid, time_range, create_time, end_time, List\<Vnode\>」

Vnode is a virtual running unit and is distributed to a specific Node. Each Vnode is a separate LSM Tree. Its corresponding tsfamily structure is a separate running unit.

![数据分片](/_static/img/buket.jpg)

### Replicaset

The high availability of data can be maintained through data replica set. Each db has its own replica group representing the number of data redundants. A set of Vnotes within the same bucket forms a replica group with the same data and inverted index information.

### Place Rule

To address the possibility of concurrent failures, the meta node may need to ensure that data copies are located on devices that use different nodes, racks, power sources, controllers and physical locations, when creating bucket. Considering that different tenants will access data at different region, Vnote should be dispatched and discharged by the way of optimal cost.

### Data Separation Strategy

Data from different tenants on Node are physically segmented.

`/User/db/bucket/replicaset_id/vnode_id`

![数据分割目录存储](/_static/img/data_path.jpg)

### Data Consensus Based on Quorum Mechanism

- #### The Cnosdb2.0 is implemented as a system with final consistency.

  The module using the Quorum mechanism to make data consensuss and handling read or write requests is called codenatoor.

    - Meta information cache, interact with meta nodes

      According to user, db, Timemange, get Vnote information, maintain a cache locally and pull VodeList from the remote without a local hit. Provide a trait of Meta Client.

    - Connection management

      Manages connections with different tskvs for data reading/writing.

    - Agent operation for data reading/writing/deleting

      Data is configured by users to support a variety of different consistency levels.

      ```Rust
      pub enum ConsistencyLevel {
          /// allows for hinted handoff, potentially no write happened yet.
          Any,
          /// at least one data node acknowledged a write/read.
          One,
          /// a quorum of data nodes to acknowledge a write/read.
          Quorum,
          /// requires all data nodes to acknowledge a write/read.
          All,
          }
      ```
    - Hinted handoff  
      Add under the scenario of a temporary failure of the target node to provide the Hinted handoff function of the continator node, which is persistently saved in the Hinted handoff queue of the node, until the copy node fails and then copied and recovered from the Hinted handoff queue.

  Data are written

  When a write request is received, the cordinator determines the physical node (note) where the data to be stored, based on the partition policy and the corresponding placement rules (place-rule). As long as at least W nodes return to success, the writing operation is considered successful.

### Writer Process

![write](/_static/img/write.jpg)

### Data Reading

When a read request is received, the cordinator determines that the physical node (note) where the data to be stored and requires this key corresponding data based on the partition policy and the corresponding placement rules (place-rule), and at present we do not perform the function of read repair (read repair) to initiate only one reading request. In the case of delay in reading, initiate a second reading request.


![read](/_static/img/read.jpg)

### Update of Conflicts

1.  After data creates conflict in a time series scenario, use consistency hash to be replaced by the first copy (replaica) as a confirmation point
2.  At the same time, the last-write-win strategy is used to resolve conflicts.

## Meta Cluster

Maintain a strong consistency meta cluster through raft. Meta cluster api serves externally, while nodes also subscribe to updates to meta information. All metadata updates are updated through the meta-data cluster.

![meta——server](/_static/img/raft.jpg)

> 1.  Database catalog information, DDL operation.
> 2.  The node probe/node registration, as well as node load information statistics, is the basis for the read and write selected by coordinator.
> 3.  Rent and sub-user information and permissions are relevant.
> 4.  Data routing information, the routing information corresponding to vnodeList corresponding to denant / db / bucket / replicaset.
> 5.  Provides the functionality of distributed locks and watch change notifications.

We adopt a strong consistency meta cluster and realize corresponding optimization. The specific reasons are as follows:

> - In practice, metadata in our cluster is usually controlled on a smaller scale and without extensible requirements.
> - Engineering practice is relatively simple and is conducive to rapid iteration.
> - Make cache and localized storage for access to frequently accessible data, optimize.
    >   - After storage locally, subscribe to schema version changes from the meta cluster to relieve the pressure of meta cluster reading.
    >   - Meta clusters share the leveler pressure and provide the Follower / Read scheme. Reading performance is optimized.

## SQL Engine

We used [DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) as the query engine. DataFusion is an extensible query execution framework, written with Rust, used [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) As its memory format. DataFusion supports SQL and DataFrame API for building logical query schemes, as well as query optimizers and execution engines that can be executed in parallel with partition data sources using threads. It has the following advantages:

1. High performance: Using the memory models of Rust and Arrow, it has high performance.
2. Strong extensibility: Allows almost any point in its design to be extended and customized with a needle-specific use case.
3. High quality: DataFusion and Arrow ecology are widely tested and can be used as production systems.
4. Fusion of large data ecology: As part of the Apache Arrow ecosystem (Arrow, Flight, Parquet), it is better integrated with large data ecosystems.

By extending DataFusion data sources and providing custom SQL statements, the query process for data under distributed scenarios is as follows:

![query](/_static/img/query_data_path.jpg)

## TSKV Index and Data Storage

tskv mainly undertakes data and index storage, manages all Vnodes on node, each Vnode is responsible for some of the data in a db. In Vnode, three modules mainly make up WAL, Index Engine and Data Engine.

![tskv](/_static/img/tskv.jpg)

### Index Engine

Indexes used to store time series data are usually models that read more and write less, mainly quickly indexing and tagkey-based conditional filtering to filter out the right series.

The main functions are:

1. Storage positive index
2. Storage reverse index
3. Caching catalog information

Common query statements:

```sql
SELECT xxx from table where tag1= value1 && tag2=value2 [and time > aaa and time  \< bbb] [group by\order by\limit ....]
```

The design of index is mainly aimed at the where filtering conditions; used to reduce the search scale of data and speed up the query efficiency of data.

Support the following filtering conditions:

> 1. Equal to; not equal to; such as: tag = value, tag! = Value
> 2. More than; less than; such as: tag  \< value
> 3. Prefix matching; such as: tag = aaa_*
> 4. Regular expressions; such as: tag = aaa*bbb

Indexes is built when the data is written. In time series database, each tag is indexed, and the corresponding value of multiple tags is combined into a searchkey. Although time series databases are writing more and reading less, the use of indexes when writing data is more read than build. Time series databases are often written to different time points of the same search, so each search&apos;s index information needs to be built only when it is first written, and if the search exists (reading operation), no longer indexed;

- #### Storage structure

    - Based on the hash function, calculate HashID: `hash (SeriesKey) -> HashID` (24-bit integer, about 16 million); 2.HashID (uint64): `HashID  \< 40 | auto_increment_id -> SeresID` is obtained.
        - FieldID (uint64) is combined by SeriesID with TableFiledID (field has a number within the table for TableFiledID).

      Conditions of limitation:
        - The number of HashIDs is about 16 million, and hundreds of millions of single machine Series will lead to List lengthening drag-and-seeking.
        - The 24th bits of FieldID are TableFiledID, and the lower 40 bits are the lower 40 bits of SeresID.

  The TSM data file stores FieldID and corresponding Data information. The information about SeresKey is stored in the index file, and the following is about the index data organization.

- #### Design of index data structure

    - HashList: `HashID-> List \< (SeriesKey, SereesID) >` for SeriesKey to interexamine with SereesID
        - SereiesKey looks for the SereesID process: `Hash (SeriesKey) -> HashID`, gets `List \<SerisKey, SereesID >` from HashList, and then traverses List for SeriesID.
        - SereesID looks for the SereesKey process, takes the 24-bit high of SeresID as HashID, and the search process is the same.
    - `TagValue -> List  \<SeriesID> `implements indexing capabilities for Tag, using tag query conditions filtering.
        - Query Conditions: `where tag = value`, get a list of SeresIDs based on TagValue, and further obtain FieldID loading data from TSM files.
        - Multiple query conditions intersect and or need to operate multiple `List\<SereesID\>`.
    - The TagValue sequence is required to store traverse access. Used `show tag value` query HashList structure requires one maintenance, inert loading in memory. `HashID-> List \< (SeriesKey, SereesID) >` and `TagValue-> List \<SeriesID>` are persistent.

### Data Engine

Data used primarily to store time series data are usually scenes that write more and read less, using LSM models, mainly to write data quickly, while removing expired and deleted data through context. DataEngine is divided into the following modules:

- #### WAL module

  For the pre-log, the WAL applies the write operation to the WAL file on disk before memory is added to the disk before memory, which will be used to restore memory to a state consistent with the collapse. When a write request is received, wal_job first checks whether the current WAL file is full, if it is full, create a new one, and then start writing it in a certain format. Each req corresponds separately to a seq-no, seq-no increment to record how many batches have been written since it started. The wal_job thread returns this seq_no to the main thread. Each point of the same batch has the same seq_no in memory or written to TSM, which is processed for seq_no.

- #### TimeSeriesFamily

  TimeSeriesFamily, a storage unit for time-order data that saves metadata for data in corresponding memory and data in corresponding disks, typically abbreviation for tsfamily, and before we write data, we generate SeresID and FieldID based on the tag and Field of the data. Coordinator gets Bucket based on db and Timemange and gets TseriesFamilyID to write data to tsfamily based on hash (SeriesID) % shard_nums. The tsfamily members are as follows:

    ```
    pub struct TseriesFamily {
        tf_id: u32,
        delta_mut_cache: Arc \<RwLock \<MemCache>>,
        delta_immut_cache: Vec \<Arc \<RwLock \<MemCache>>>,
        mut_cache: Arc \<RwLock \<MemCache>>,
        immut_cache: Vec \<Arc \<RwLock \<MemCache>>>,
        super_version: Arc \<SuperVersion>,
        super_version_id: AtomicU64,
        version: Arc \<RwLock \<Version>>,
        opts: Arc \<TseriesFamOpt>,
        seq_no: u64,
        immut_ts_min: i64,
        mut_ts_max: i64,
    }
    ```

  `tf_id`: tthe identifier of tsfamily, each tsfamily has the only tf_id.

  `mut-cache`: For the latest data written in a cache

  `immut-cache`: When the mut-cache is full, turn to `immut-chache`, `immut-cache` flash to disk to generate TSM files.

  `super-version`: Snapshot data from the current `mut-cache` and `immut-cache` of tsfimily.

  `version`: Maintains snapshots of disk data in the current tsfaimily.

- #### Recover and Summary

  Summmarry is a metadata file generated by changes in the version of the TSM file, which stores the sample file. The system file stores version-change metadata version_edit for outage recovery of `version_set` metadata. The node runs for a long time to generate larger summary files, and we regularly integrate the summary file to reduce the time of outage recovery.

  tskv first performs the recover function when creating:

    - Gets the summary structure from the sample file.
    - According to the `last_seq` of ctx of the schema structure, know which batch has been filed by flush
    - According to the wal file and `last_seq`, the base that is not rewritten into memory by the flush
    - Restore `version_set` based on the summary file

- #### Flush

  When the `immut-cache` capacity in tsfamily reaches a certain extent, the flash starts after the execution of the write operation, when it is found that the `immut-cache` is full, pack it into a `flash_request`, which is received by the `flash_job` thread after processing.

    - Remove data from the `flash-request` and create a `flash_task` based on data, executed
    - According to `TseriesFamilyID`, FileID creates a TSM file that writes data to the TSM file
    - According to file information, the application metadata corresponds to the `Levels_info` of the version
    - Generate versioned it based on modifications to version and `seq-no`, TseriesFamilyID, etc
    - Send all generated `version edit` to the `summary_task_sender` created together at the time of creation of tskv, and the thread receives the request and starts processing, and writes the `version_edit` to the summary file.

- #### compaction

  We use the class LSMtree method to sort data. Typically, data from time series databases are written in chronological manner. But IoT has scenarios that make up data, leading to time stamps. In addition, it is difficult to ensure the order of writing for all users due to network delays in public cloud scenarios. In the face of multiple complex write-in scenarios, we need to consider a variety of complex scenarios when performing data.

  The purpose of the operation is:

    - Aggregate small tsm files to generate larger tsm files.
    - Clean up files that have expired or marked to delete.
    - Reduce reading magnification and maintain the metadata of `level_info` in our current version.

- #### level_range compaction

  ![level_range](/_static/img/level_range.jpg)

    - Typically, time series databases are written in order to respond to disorderly data, we add delta files. The data of Delta is brushed to the L0 layer.
    - From L1 to L3, The data of `LevelInfo` are classified by time. Each layer has a fixed time range and does not overlap, and the data in memcache has a fixed timerange. Each layer of time is dynamically updated when it works or flashes.
    - Each newly written TSM file has the latest time range of the layer. That is, `TimeRange ( ts_min, ts_max)`, `ts_max` is the largest in the time range held by file id largest TSM file in the L0 layer.
    - The pick process of the compact creates a virtual `time_window`. `time_window` selects the appropriate TSM file in this layer for compaction to the next floor, while updating the data of this layer `Level_info`. Update TSMin in `Level_info` to maximum timestamp of `time_window`, the time range of this layer goes forward. The newly generated TSM file is placed on the next floor and ts_max of the next layer is propelled to the maximum value of `time_window`.
    - At the beginning of L3, the TSM file is divided by directory by table; and the same table TSM file is placed together. Supports the generation of the parquet file and is graded on S3.

- #### time_window compaction

  ![time_window](/_static/img/time_range.jpg)

    - Window-based components are performed in different lev_lange modes, from immut_cache flash to disk, generating different TSM files into the corresponding windows based on the time range of TSM, and windows are created dynamically over time. Each windows is responsible for writing for some time.

    - There are some discrete data tsm file blocks within windows that need to be merged to generate larger file blocks. The windows internal maintains a list of metadata about files. Compared with the mode of integration with Level_range, the performance of time_window reduces the amplification of writing.

- #### data_engine data stream

  ![data_flow](/_static/img/data_engine.jpg)

## Other System Design

### Concession of tenants

- #### query layer

  In DataFusion, the catalog isolation relationship is divided into `catalog/schema/table`. We use this isolation relationship, which is separated between tenants as `tenant (namespace) / database / table`.

    - Table corresponds to a specific table in a specific database that provides a specific table schema definition implementation TableProvider
    - Database corresponds to a dataabase, which manages multiple tables under a specific database.
    - Namespace corresponds to Catalog. Each tenant occupies only one catalog, and the db seen in different tenants is different, and different tenants can use the same Database name. When the user logs in, take TenantID in the session by default to see his namespace, which means namespace has a soft isolation effect.

- #### tskv layer

  The directory segmentation policy mentioned in the above introduction: `/User/db/book/replicationset_id/vnode_id/tskv` is an instance on each Node node. Save all Vnote information on the current Node. Each Vnode saves the data under a separate directory. Clean up the data based on the configuration db retion policy. At the same time, we can easily carry out the data directory size statistics, the tenant is billed.
