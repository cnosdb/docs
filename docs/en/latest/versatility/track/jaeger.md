## Enable Jaeger support in CnosDB

Uncomment the [trace] configuration to enable Jaeger tracing.
> Tip: You need to restart the server for the configuration to take effect.

```toml
[trace]
  auto_generate_span = false
[trace.log]
  path = '/tmp/cnosdb'
[trace.jaeger]
  jaeger_agent_endpoint = 'http://127.0.0.1:14268/api/traces'
  max_concurrent_exports = 2
  max_queue_size = 4096
```

## Deploy and Start Jaeger

> Other methods of deployment, please refer to [Jaeger Deployment](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/deployment/).

```bash
docker run -d --name jaeger \
-p 6831:6831/udp \
-p 6832:6832/udp \
-p 16686:16686 \
-p 14268:14268 \
jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```

When you start Jaeger successfully, visit [http://127.0.0.1:16686](http://127.0.0.1:16686).

## Trace CnosDB with Jaeger

1. Add `span context` to the request header.

> It can be automatically generated by setting `auto_generate_span = true` in the config file, and if you need to analyze a specific statement, you can customize the `uber-trace-id` value in the request, in the following format (refer to the format for more details: [Propagation Format](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.46/client-libraries/#propagation-format)).

```bash
uber-trace-id: 3a3a43:432e345:0:1
```

Example:

> The data source in the example: https://docs.cnosdb.com/zh/latest/start/quick_start.html 

> Query the `air` table in the database `oceanic_station` and sort the data in reverse order, returning the first 5 data.

```bash
curl -i -u "root:" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "uber-trace-id: 3a3a43:432e345:0:1" -XPOST "http://127.0.0.1:8902/api/v1/sql?db=oceanic_station&pretty=true" -d "select * from air order by time desc limit 5;"
```

## Use the Dashboard for Analysis

1. Record Span:

When a client application sends a query or write request to the CnosDB database, CnosDB sends the resulting Span record to Jaeger. Each span represents a phase of the request and includes the processing time, operation name, and other relevant information.

2. Select Service:

In the Service drop-down box of the Jaeger user interface, select the service related to CnosDB (for example: cnosdb_singleton_1001).

3. Find Traces:

On the interface, click the "Find Traces" button and the system will retrieve all traces associated with the selected service. This will display a list of requests and corresponding spans.

4. Analyze Trace details:

Click the trace of interest to enter the detailed view. In this view, you'll see the flow of the request and the time each span takes to execute. This timing information will help you understand how long each step of the query takes to process.

5. Optimize queries and systems:

With detailed timing logs, you can accurately analyze the performance of your query. In a production environment, this can be a valuable tool for optimizing queries and improving system performance. By analyzing the execution time of each span, you can find the steps that may be causing delays, so you can take targeted optimization actions.

In addition to this, Jaeger can track other events for CnosDB, check out: [ISSUE 1272](https://github.com/cnosdb/cnosdb/issues/1272)
