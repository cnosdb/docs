# Start

CnosDB is a time-series database dedicated to collecting, storing and processing time-series data, which is non-related, based on typographical storage, and supports high-quality, reliable, extensive, high-performance and low-cost data storage and queries.

CnosDB is designed to address the storage and query of time-series data for sea volume.The main applications of time-series data are in the fields of transport, IOT and finance, covering online and batch operations in terms of business characteristics, and the time series database covers both analytical (OLAP) and operations (OLTP) business scenarios.In theory, the time-series database should belong to a subcategory of OLAP but it is often divided into a separate group because of the sufficiently different reading and writing patterns of the time-series database.

In this chapter, you will be informed about how to use CnosDB, including how to install, start, connect, create databases, create tables, insert data, query data, etc. to help you have a preliminary understanding of the time series database.
